    "### Network Requests\n",
    "When you enter a URL (e.g., www.brookings.edu) into your browser, several things happen:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **DNS Lookup*\n",
    "   - Your browser first translates the human-readable URL (e.g. http://brookings.edu/) into an IP address (e.g. 137.135.107.235) using a Domain Name System (DNS) lookup. Think of the DNS search like the phone book that links a name of a store to a street address. \n",
    "   \n",
    "   This IP address points to the server where the website is hosted. Your computer now has the address to which it can send its web request.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **HTTP Request**:\n",
    "   - The browser sends an HTTP (HyperText Transfer Protocol) request to the server at this IP address. This request asks for the main HTML file of the website.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Server Response**:\n",
    "   - The server processes this request and sends back the requested HTML file. This file contains the basic structure of the webpage (We'll look at an example of one of these)\n",
    "\n",
    "4. **Rendering HTML**:\n",
    "   - Your browser starts rendering the HTML file, which often includes references to other resources like CSS files, JavaScript files, images, fonts, and videos.\n",
    "\n",
    "5. **Additional Requests**:\n",
    "   - For each of these additional resources, the browser makes more HTTP requests to the server. For example:\n",
    "     - **CSS Files**: To style the webpage.\n",
    "     - **JavaScript Files**: To add interactivity and dynamic content.\n",
    "     - **Images and Videos**: To include multimedia content.\n",
    "     - **APIs**: Sometimes, the HTML or JavaScript code includes API requests. APIs (Application Programming Interfaces) allow the browser to request and receive data from servers, often in JSON format, which can then be dynamically displayed on the webpage.\n",
    "\n",
    "6. **Assembling the Page**:\n",
    "   - The browser assembles all these elements and displays the fully rendered webpage to you.\n",
    "\n",
